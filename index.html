            <h1>WHAT’S DIFFERENT?</h1>
            <p>Many an individual can create an application similar to Papo, however, the Papo application, as a result of its unique approach to user security, will provide assurance to the renters through a proprietary approach to car renting in the digital space. That will allow the company to mitigate risk and spur confidence with renters.
